# Secret-Sharing---Chinese-Remainder-Theorem

This is a python proof of concept of Mignotte's secret sharing algorithm using Chinese Remainder Theorem.<sup>[1]</sup> 

To be implemented in C, soon.

**Disclaimer:** Do not use this script to actually share secrets. They probably won't actaully be all that secret. 
The selected parameters are too small to prevent a brute force attack.
